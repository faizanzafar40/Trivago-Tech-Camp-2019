## Setup Information:

- For the purpose of deploying my solution to the case study, simply host the HTML files on a local server using xampp  

- Download and install xampp and place the HTML files in a new directory `C:\xampp\htdocs\test` 

- You can access the files from your browser via the following link: [http://localhost/test/Ada_Lovelace.html](http://localhost/test/Ada_Lovelace.html)

- Then, execute the file `main_program.py` to run the application

- Adhering to separation of concerns, I have kept my solution quite clean and precise. Moreover, I have included inline comments and meaningful variable/function names to promote code readability.
