## Setup Information:

- Download this repository

- For the setup environment, Visual Studio Code is recommended

- Host the HTML files on a local server using xampp  

- Download and install xampp and simply place the HTML files in a new directory `C:\xampp\htdocs\test` 

- You can access each of the files from your browser by modifying the following link with your desired file: [http://localhost/test/Ada_Lovelace.html](http://localhost/test/Ada_Lovelace.html)

- From the main repository, access the directory **_my_project_** 

- Execute the file `main_program.py` in the same directory

- Adhering to separation of concerns, I have kept my solution quite clean and precise

- I have included inline comments and meaningful variable/container/function names to promote code readability
