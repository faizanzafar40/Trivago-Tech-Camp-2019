Why are you interested in the Tech Camp and what would you like to learn?

My motives for becoming an active participant of the Trivago Tech Camp are focused towards innovation and technological advancement; 
to constructively engage with interesting computing challenges and develop meaningful solutions, while exploring relevant cutting edge 
technologies. I believe the Trivago Tech Camp will expose me to the vast dynamics at work at an international level. I aim to gain 
practical experience and enhance my skillset while being an encouraging influence on fellow participants, throughout the camp.
Application-oriented training and getting to learn new tech paradigms are some aspects that truly excite me. Another enticing attribute
of the camp is the inter-disciplinary exposure it provides in the form of workshops and learning sessions.

I am significantly intrigued by the applications of data driven systems in the real world. I would like to learn modern methods and 
technologies for data visualization and text processing. I am also quite interested in agile processes and user experience design.

I sincerely hope that my credentials will prove worthy of the Tech Camp. I am truly looking forward to the possibility of attending the
camp and becoming a part of the learning dynamic that Trivago has to offer. I am also available to provide any further information if
needed.
